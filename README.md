- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clairemurray24 and have some coding experience. I wanted to take this class because it seems like a good opportunity to learn things about coding that I haven't done before. I really like to play sports like tennis, swimming, and lacrosse. My goals for this class are to learn new things and become a stronger coder.
